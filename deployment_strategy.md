## Overview

The deployment strategy is designed to:

- Facilitate smooth transitions between development, staging, and production environments.
- Automate the deployment process to reduce human error.
- Ensure high availability and quick recovery from failures.
- Maintain security and compliance standards.

---

## Environments

- **Development:** Local environment for developers to build and test features.
- **Staging:** Mirror of the production environment for final testing before release.
- **Production:** Live environment accessible to end-users.

---

## Deployment Workflow

1. **Code Commit:** Developers push code to the `develop` branch.
2. **Automated Testing:** CI pipeline runs unit and integration tests.
3. **Staging Deployment:** Upon successful tests, code is merged into the `staging` branch and deployed to the staging environment.
4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** QA team performs testing in the staging environment.
5. **Production Deployment:** After approval, code is merged into the `main` branch and deployed to production.

---

## Infrastructure Setup

- **Hosting:** The website is hosted on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).
- **Web Server:** Nginx or Apache serves the frontend.
- **Application Server:** PHP-FPM handles backend processing.
- **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL managed by the cloud provider.
- **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic across multiple instances for high availability.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Serves static assets to reduce load times.

---

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **CI/CD Tools:** Utilize tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI for automating the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Pipeline Steps:**
  - Code linting and formatting checks.
  - Running automated tests.
  - Building application artifacts.
  - Deploying to staging/production environments.
- **Notifications:** Integrate with communication tools (e.g., Slack, email) to notify teams of deployment statuses.

---

## Rollback Procedures

In case of deployment failures:

1. **Automatic Rollback:** CI/CD pipeline detects failures and reverts to the previous stable version.
2. **Manual Rollback:** Operations team can manually deploy a previous release using version tags.
3. **Database Rollback:** Restore the database from the latest backup if schema changes cause issues.

---

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Monitoring Tools:** Implement tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic to monitor system performance and uptime.
- **Logging:** Centralize logs using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or cloud-native solutions for easier debugging and auditing.
- **Alerts:** Set up alerts for critical issues like downtime, high error rates, or performance degradation.

---

## Security Considerations

- **SSL/TLS:** Enforce HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- **Firewall Rules:** Restrict access to servers and databases.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep all software dependencies up to date to patch vulnerabilities.
- **Access Control:** Implement role-based access controls and use SSH keys for server access.
- **Secrets Management:** Store sensitive information using secure methods (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).

---

## Backup and Recovery

- **Database Backups:** Schedule regular automated backups with retention policies.
- **File Backups:** Backup uploaded media and configuration files.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Document procedures for restoring services in case of catastrophic failures.

---

## Maintenance and Updates

- **Scheduled Maintenance:** Plan and announce maintenance windows to minimize user impact.
- **Performance Optimization:** Regularly review and optimize code and database queries.
- **Deprecation Policy:** Clearly define how and when outdated features or APIs will be removed.
