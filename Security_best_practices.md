## 1. Authentication and Authorization

- Enforce **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for admin-level users.
- Apply **role-based access control** (RBAC) in WordPress.
- Use strong, randomly generated passwords with a password manager.
- Disable default admin usernames and rename login URLs.

---

## 2. Data Protection

- Use **HTTPS** for all pages using valid SSL certificates.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using tools or managed services.
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL Injection.
- Store secrets (e.g., database credentials) in environment variables, not in code.

---

## 3. WordPress Hardening

- Remove unused themes and plugins to reduce attack surface.
- Keep all plugins and themes updated via automated or monitored processes.
- Install a WordPress security plugin (e.g., Wordfence, Sucuri) for real-time protection.
- Disable file editing via the WordPress dashboard (`DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT`).
- Restrict access to sensitive files (`wp-config.php`, `.htaccess`, etc.).

---

## 4. Secure Deployment

- Use **Git-based deployments** to track code changes and prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Implement access controls for deployment servers.
- Avoid direct deployments to productionâ€”use staging environments to test changes.
- Automate deployment processes to reduce human error.

---

## 5. Update and Patch Management

- Regularly update WordPress core, plugins, themes, and server software.
- Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor CVE alerts.
- Use monitoring tools to identify outdated components.

---

## 6. Monitoring and Incident Response

- Enable access and error logs for the server and application.
- Use a centralized logging service (e.g., Loggly, ELK Stack) to correlate events.
- Set up alerting for failed login attempts, unauthorized changes, and critical errors.
- Maintain a documented incident response plan with roles and recovery steps.

---

## 7. Secure Development Practices

- Adopt secure coding standards (e.g., OWASP Secure Coding Guidelines).
- Use code linters and static analysis tools to detect security issues early.
- Conduct regular code reviews with security-focused checklists.
- Avoid hardcoding credentials or tokens in codebases.

---

## 8. CI/CD Security

- Secure GitHub repositories with branch protection rules and review policies.
- Scan pull requests with automated security linters (e.g., CodeQL).
- Restrict secrets and credentials using GitHub Secrets or similar tools.
- Validate all workflows for potentially dangerous commands or permissions.

---

## 9. Third-party Dependencies

- Vet third-party plugins and themes before use.
- Prefer well-maintained and widely adopted libraries.
- Monitor dependencies using tools like `npm audit`, `snyk`, or `dependabot`.
- Immediately remove deprecated or unmaintained packages.

---

## 10. Backup and Recovery

- Automate daily backups of the database and WordPress files.
- Store backups in a secure, offsite location.
- Test backup recovery processes periodically to ensure integrity.
- Encrypt backups before transmission or storage.

---

## Additional Recommendations

- Enable a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for additional protection.
- Regularly perform vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
- Educate team members on social engineering and phishing awareness.
