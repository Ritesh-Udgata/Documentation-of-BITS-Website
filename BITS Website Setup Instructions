# BITS Website Setup Instructions

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the BITS official website locally. It covers the installation of dependencies, environment configuration, and running the website on your local machine. The website is built on WordPress, so this guide includes instructions specific to setting up a WordPress environment for development.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the following software is installed on your system:

- **PHP** (Version 7.4 or higher recommended)
- **MySQL/MariaDB** (for managing the WordPress database)
- **Apache** or **Nginx** (or any other web server)
- **Git** (for version control)
- **Composer** (for PHP dependency management, if applicable)
- **Node.js and npm** (if frontend dependencies or build tools are required)
- A local development environment like **XAMPP**, **MAMP**, or **LocalWP**

## Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bits-website.git
   ```
4. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd bits-website
   ```

## Installing Dependencies

### WordPress Core & Plugins

1. **Core Installation:**
   - Ensure you have a copy of WordPress. If the repository does not include the core, download it from the [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/download/).
   - Place the WordPress core files in the project directory if they aren’t already included.

2. **Plugin & Theme Dependencies:**
   - **Manual Installation:** Download and extract necessary plugins/themes into the `wp-content/plugins` or `wp-content/themes` directories.
   - **Composer (Optional):**
     - If the project manages PHP packages via Composer, run:
       ```bash
       composer install
       ```
     - This command installs all required PHP libraries as specified in the `composer.json`.

3. **Node.js Dependencies (If Applicable):**
   - For themes or front-end build tools:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - To build frontend assets:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```

## Configuring the Environment

### Environment Variables

1. **Create a .env File:**
   - In the root directory, create a file named `.env` to store environment-specific configurations.
   - An example `.env` file:
     ```env
     # BITS Website Environment Configuration
     WP_HOME=http://localhost/bits-website
     WP_SITEURL=${WP_HOME}/wp
     DB_NAME=bits_db
     DB_USER=root
     DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
     DB_HOST=localhost
     ```
   - Modify these values to match your local environment.

### WordPress Configuration

1. **Configure wp-config.php:**
   - Duplicate the provided `wp-config-sample.php` file and rename it to `wp-config.php`.
   - Open `wp-config.php` and update the database settings to match your `.env` file or local setup:
     ```php
     define( 'DB_NAME', getenv('DB_NAME') );
     define( 'DB_USER', getenv('DB_USER') );
     define( 'DB_PASSWORD', getenv('DB_PASSWORD') );
     define( 'DB_HOST', getenv('DB_HOST') );
     ```
   - Configure other settings as needed.

## Database Setup

1. **Create the Database:**
   - Open your preferred MySQL client (e.g., phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or terminal).
   - Create a new database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE bits_db;
     ```

2. **Import Existing Data (if available):**
   - If a database dump (`dump.sql`) is provided, import it using:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p bits_db < path/to/dump.sql
     ```

## Running the Project Locally

### Using a Local Server (XAMPP/MAMP/LocalWP)

1. **For XAMPP/MAMP:**
   - Place your project in the designated web directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
   - Start the Apache and MySQL services.
   - Access the site by navigating to: [http://localhost/bits-website](http://localhost/bits-website)

### Using Docker (Optional)

If a Docker configuration is provided:

1. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2. In the project root, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. The website should be accessible at the configured domain (e.g., [http://localhost](http://localhost)).

## Running Test Cases

To verify the website’s functionality and security:

1. **PHP Unit Tests:**
   - If tests are written using PHPUnit, run:
     ```bash
     ./vendor/bin/phpunit
     ```
2. **Custom Test Scripts:**
   - If additional test scripts are available in the `tests` directory:
     ```bash
     bash tests/run_tests.sh
     ```
3. **GitHub Actions:**
   - The project may also include GitHub Actions workflows that automatically run tests. Check the Actions tab in the repository for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Database Connection Errors:**
  - Verify that the credentials in `.env` and `wp-config.php` are correct.
  - Ensure the MySQL service is running.

- **Missing Dependencies:**
  - Re-run `composer install` or `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.
  - Confirm that WordPress core files are correctly placed.

- **File Permission Issues:**
  - Ensure that the web server has read and write permissions for the project directories.

### Logs

- **Web Server Logs:**
  - Check Apache or Nginx logs for server errors.
- **PHP Error Logs:**
  - Inspect PHP error logs to troubleshoot runtime issues.

## Additional Notes

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - This guide is updated periodically. Always refer to the repository for the latest setup instructions.
- **Contributing:**
  - Follow the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for any modifications to this documentation.
